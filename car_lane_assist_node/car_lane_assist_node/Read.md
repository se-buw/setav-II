Here you will find two approaches of Steering Control:

1. Direct steering angle calculation: this file subscribes data from Lane detection which is coordinates of middle curve of lane lines. After processing data and calculating steering angle is then published for further use.
2. Steering angle calculation by PID control technique: you will find implementation of PID approach to calculate steering angle.
