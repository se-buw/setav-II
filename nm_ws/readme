This repository contains the necessary files to set up a ROS2-based robot simulation workspace using RViz and Gazebo.

The instructions provided below assume that you have ROS2 Humble, Rviz, and Gazebo installed on your machine.
If not, please install them using the following links:
1. ROS2 Humble: https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html
2. Rviz: http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/UserGuide
3. Gazebo: https://classic.gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install_ubuntu

Setup:

Workspace and Repository Setup:
1. Create a workspace directory named nm_ws and within this workspace, create a new folder called src.
2. Navigate to the src folder and clone the nm_ws repository from Git:
cd nm_ws/src
git clone [repository_url]

Build and Source the Workspace:
1. Navigate to the nm_ws directory and use colcon build with the --symlink-install flag:
cd nm_ws/
colcon build --symlink-install

2. Source the directory using the following command:
source install/setup.bash

Launching the Robot in RViz
1. In a new terminal, start RViz:
rviz2
2. Open another new terminal and launch the robot:
ros2 launch nm_robot rsp.launch.py
3. In a new terminal, start the joint state publisher GUI:
ros2 run joint_state_publisher_gui joint_state_publisher_gui

Launching the Robot in Gazebo:
1. Open a new terminal and launch the robot in Gazebo using the following command:
ros2 launch nm_robot launch_sim.launch.py world:=./src/nm_robot/worlds/testlayout.world

2. To activate navigation, open a new terminal window and type:
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard

Using Sensors in RViz
Lidar Sensor
1. In RViz, click on 'Add' at the bottom left of the menu.
2. From the pop-up menu, select 'Laser' and press OK.
3. Under the Laser menu displayed on the left, go to the 'Topic' field and from the dropdown, select /scan.

Camera Sensor
1. In RViz, click on 'Add' at the bottom left of the menu.
2. From the pop-up menu, select 'Image' and press OK.
3. Under the Image menu displayed on the left, go to the 'Topic' field and from the dropdown, select /raw_image.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any errors, such as "Package not found,"
make sure to source the workspace using the command source install/setup.bash each time you open a new terminal window.
This will ensure that any new changes made to the files are reflected.
